# Newsletter API

This project is a simple Newsletter API built with Express.js, featuring rate limiting and Swagger documentation. The API allows users to sign up for a newsletter, check if an email is subscribed, and unsubscribe. The subscribers are stored in a JSON file. This API is used in my tutorials, courses and projects on [pixelrocket.store](https://www.pixelrocket.store)

## Features

- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per IP address.
- **Swagger Documentation:** Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API.
- **JSON File Storage:** Subscriber data is stored in a JSON file for simplicity.
